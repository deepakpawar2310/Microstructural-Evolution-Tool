# Microstructural-Evolution-Tool

Microstructural Evolution Tool (MET) that can be employed to investigate the morphological changes 
that occur during triaxial compression and quantify these morphological changes. 
This tool will also help in assessing the behaviour of granular samples for combinations of practically relevant conditions such as 
packing fraction ($\bar{\eta}$), friction coefficient ($\mu$), particle size or polydispersity index ($\lambda$), particle shape or aspect ratio ($r$) and confinement stress ($\sigma$). 
Additionally, by examine the extent of similarity and dissimilarity of microstructural and the particle participation durning mesoscopic deformation can provide deeper 
insights into material behaviour under triaxial loading. 
By addressing these aspects and integrating particle-level deformation with mesoscopic mechanics, 
it is possible to gain a comprehensive understanding of particle deformation during triaxial compression.
